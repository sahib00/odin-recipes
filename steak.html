<h4>INGREDIENTS</h4>
<ul>
  <li>1 Butcher's steak (2 pounds)</li>
  <li>Salt and fresly grounded black pepper to taste</li>
<li>1 tablespoon clarified butter</li>
<li> 2/3 cup chicken broth</li>

  <li>Salt to Taste</li>
</ul>


<h4>PROCIDURE</h4>

<ol>
  <li> Remove all silver skin and extra fat from the steak.Carefully
  cut out the connective tissue that connects the two halves of the steak,
  separating the whole into 2 long pieces.Cut lobe of meat from one half(it's a piece slightly
  seperated from the larger half).Then cut each of the 2 larger halves into 2 steaks each.Sprinkle
  with salt and pepper.
  </li>
  <li>Heat skillet over high heat.Add clarified butter when pan is hot,
then place the steaks in the pan.Reduce heat to medium.Cook untill browned on all sides, firm and
reddish-pink on the inside.an instant-read thermometer inserted into the centre should
read 125 degrees F (52 degrees C), a total of about 12 minutes.(This cut of meat has a sort of triangular shape,
so about 4 minutes per side.)Transfer to a warm plate and tent with foil to let steaks rest and allow
temparature to rise to 130 degrees F.   </li>

<li>Pour stock into skillet set over medium heat.Stir with a wooden spoon scraping up the browned bits from the bottom.
  when brownings dissolve and liquid begins to reduce after 2 or 3 minutes, reduce heat to low.Add accumulated
 juices from the meat, balsamic vinegar and butter chunks.Cook and stir untill butter melts.
 If liquid has reduced too much, add a splash of broth.Taste to check if sauce needs a bit of salt.</li>
 <li>To serve, slice steak and spoon pan sauce over them.</li>
</ol>
